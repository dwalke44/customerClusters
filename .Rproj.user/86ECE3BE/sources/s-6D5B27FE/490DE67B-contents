Description: This package provides two primary functions. The first will process a numeric dataframe so that it can be
               entered into clustering or other ML algorithms. The second function can take input from the first,
               performs HDBSCAN clustering, and then trains a random forest object to model the cluster solution and provide
               assignment capabilities for new observations.
